## Details for teaching team
The Idea for this web app is that the people who would run it don't need any advanced
skills to modify add or delete items in the blog or catalog. The only thing they
need to do is to Log In  and the features will present to them in a very easy way
to use.

In this web App you will need a user and a password
The user name is:  somebody@harvard.edu
The password is: crimson

For seeing the emails you should change the configuration in the contactController
file with your own credentials to see the mails that the page sends.
